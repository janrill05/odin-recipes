<h1>TOMATO PASTE:</h1>
<p>You’ll notice that two cans of tomato paste are used in this recipe. It may seem like a lot, but tomato paste</p>
<p>has a super concentrated tomato flavor. By adding in so much, we’re able to get a nice, strong tomato flavor,</p>
<p>without adding too much liquid to the sauce.</p>
